Good Websites:
Google: Google.com I like google because it has a clean professional layout
Tumblr: Tumblr.com Catching innovative pictures and format
Canva: Canva.com Fun interactive engaging layout
Facebook: Facebook.com Effectively condenses information into a clean organized format

Room for improvement:
Yahoo: Yahoo.com Format is messy, distracting advertisements
GRT: GunnRobotics.com Is not bad, but font is too small and is not engaging
